[Last modification: 05 March, 2008]The p-code version of NAFX requires the following functions:	NAFX.m	nameclean.m  (at the end of nafx.m, but also found in 'utilities' folder)	detectfovs.m	nafx_gui.m		All the text from all of these functions must be copied into one file, named "nafx.m".  Save this file in a separate folder from your original nafx.m.(That said, there are several other files that are required, but they are part of the standard OMtools distribution, and NAFX was never intended to be used outside of the OMtools environment, as it would be an unnecessarily complex task to set up and maintain it as a standalone suite.)You will also need the file "nafxprep.m"  It can not be built into the pcode because it is invoked through a GUI button's 'callback' feature, which requires that the function be available from the base workspace.  Therefore, "nafxprep.m" needs to be kept as a separate file.  You have the option to build it as a p-file or simply leave it as an m-file, as it contains none of the crown jewels.MATLAB's pcode function can NOT build a p file for any previous version.  So if you wish to have a p-file that can be run on multiple versions of MATLAB, you must build it with the earliest version (most likely 5.2.1).Once you have assembled the file with all the subfunctions, and have selected which version of MATLAB you will use to build NAFX, navigate to the folder containing the full version of nafx.m and from the command line type (without the quotes): "pcode nafx"That should be all you need to do to make nafx.p.  For distribution, copy nafx.p to the OMtools public release "Analysis" folder.
