                                    MATLAB INSTRUCTIONSBEFORE OPENING data files, use 'BIASGEN' to place an 'adjbias.txt' file in the data directoryOPEN data files with 'RD'   (Use adjbias.txt file with default settings)PLOT and LABEL data using 'plt(h,v,t,hv,hvt,hvh,hvth)'   [It contains,      t=maket(rh);      plot(t,rh,'c',t,lh,'y--',...)      text(maxt,maxpt,'REH') etc.      title(namelist)      ept      dragger]   Use dragger to align traces and labelsOTHER available utilities are:   gtext, textedit, linedit, axisedit, killobj,   posedit, draw, rotplot (help in contents.txt)To OPEN an ASCII data file (FileNAME.asc):	Use 'load2' and double clcick on the file	Plot all the data using plot(FileNAME) [NOTE CAPS]		(Use zoomtool to view channels of interest)		 To CREATE a VELOCITY array use 'rhv=d2pt(rh);'PRINT figure with 'print', 'print -dps[c]', 'print -dljet3'      zoomtool figure with 'print -noui'BEFORE using 'RD' to import the next data file, use   'dataclr' or 'clear all'   (use first letter of previous commands and uparrow)   ('fig' creates a new figure; otherwise, 'plot' overwrites;   figures can be closed or minimized)   BEFORE using dragger on new data, UPDATE itTo UNFOLD IR data segments:	Open file "fml#.dat" with 'RD' (# = monoc cal file#)		e.g., fml1.dat = re & fml2.dat = le	Plot array with 'plot(arrayname)' e.g., plot(rh)	Use 'zoomtool' to identify folded start and endpoints (sample #'s)	Use 'BBEdit' to place start and endpoints in "fml#.u"		e.g.,	rh 1246 1359				rh 5297 5825				rh 5494 5583 (Note: this segment is within previous one)				lh 5187 5781	Close 'zoomtool' and 'clear all'	Repeat above steps for the other monoc cal file	Open file with 'RD' and CALIBRATE (see below)	Either before or after CALIBRATION, unfold segments in other data files		(e.g., "fml(1-n).dat")	Use 'BBEdit' to place start and endpoints in "fm(1-n).u"To CALIBRATE a data file use 'pickdata' (all files allowed)   'os' (offset and shift)   place cursor on 0-bias point (use keypad 4 & 6 to move cursor)   click x,y button   CR in cmd wndw   repeat for +/-15 calibrations (15/x,y/CR and -15/x,y/CR)   quit w 'Q'   *** If cal quits, check/retrieve values already obtained using:   	'z_adjust, max_cal, max_scale, min_cal, min_scale'   To MANUALLY CALIBRATE a data array use 'adj' e.g., data from 'rdgresty'	e.g., rh=adj(rh,0#,10,cal#,-10,cal#);	[0# & cal#s obtained from 'os' and stored in adjbias.txt]To PLOT SUBARRAYS, use             'plot(sub(t,startime,interval),sub(rh,startime,interval),'c')'   or define the subarrays first and then plot.  For example,            't105=sub(t,10,5);' and 'rh105=sub(rh,10,5);' then,            'plot(t105,rh105)'To PLOT NEW DATA onto a figure use 'hold on' (like XYD in ASYST);   use 'hold off' to make new plot (like XY in ASYST)   To PLOT several different plots on one page, use'subplot(r,c,#)' to select	which subplot you will plot on (#=l to r, top to bot)      plot(t,rh); choose another using subplot and plot....For FOVEAL AXES, use 'fovax' [Be sure that ranges of both of the axes enclose 0]To SAVE a Figure to a file, use 'savefig'To LOAD a Figure into Matlab, use 'loadfig'To REDUCE the storage SIZE of a Figure, use 'shrinky'To CHANGE all OBJECTS of a Figure to WHITE, use 'bleach'To COPY a Figure into PPT, use 'ppsize' and 'shrinky' (e.g., =2) and then         'Edit-->Copy Options-->Pict-Honor Fig Size-No PS (Pict)' and					8/23/01: Turned OFF Honor Fig Size for better results         'Edit-->Copy' or 'Cmd-c'          Open PPT and import using 'Paste' or 'Cmd-v'          Double click on background and save as a metafile.To INSERT a QT Movie made from MatLab (e.g. from 'eyeballs') into PPT:         Open the QT movie         In the 'File-Save AS' menu, choose 'Make movie self-contained'         Save As 'samename' into another folder         Open the PPT file and Insert movie from same folder as the PPT fileTo COPY a Figure into Word,Method 1: [Looks better]			In Matlab:			   Use 'cd2' to get to folder where fig is to be saved			   Use 'print -djpeg100 filename'			In Word:			   Insert->Object->From File			     Choose object			     InsertMethod 2: [Prints better]			In Matlab:				Under File/Preferences/Copy,					Check "White Background", "Honor Fig Size Properties" and					select "EPS" in popup menu				Use 'shrinky' to decimate the data (optional)				Use 'bleach' to turn all colors to white (optional)				Use 'posedit' to set Fig size as it is to appear in Word (opt)					Save as 'fig_BW.m'				Copy (Cmd-c)			In Word:				Paste (Cmd-v)				To COPY a Figure into a .PCX file, use         'Edit-->Copy Options-->W Bitmap' and         'Edit-->Copy'          Open WPB and import using 'Paste'          Save As a .PCX file for slide or PPT To CHANGE axes ticks between 'manual' and 'auto' use  			'autxtick' sets x-axis ticks to 'auto'                                        			'autytick' sets y-axis ticks to 'auto'                                      			'manxtick' sets x-axis ticks to 'manual'                                       			'manytick' sets y-axis ticks to 'manual' 			To PRINT a Figure a certain size, use 			'posedit' to set page size, origins, and sizes                                       To PRINT a complicated figure with 3-D plots etc. 			'loadgfig' and resize it slightly 			'textedit' to set axes' non-zero angles 			'print'        To read in points taken from data	Open BBedit file	Enter number pairs or arrays (e.g., ampl vel)	Save on Desktop	Use 'load2' to enter array in BBEdit file	Identify columns (or rows) using name1=filename(:,col#1) and name2=filename(:,col#2) etc.	Plot data (e.g., 'plot(name1,name2)')
