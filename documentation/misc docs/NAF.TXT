                                   NAF(X)Theory:The NAF and later NAFX originated from the NFF which attempted to relate the time-intervals of fp's and their position and velocity SD's to a measure of the 'quality' of a CN waveform (i.e., how lilely it was to allow good acuity).  When calculated by hand, each cycle was assumed to have 1 fp and the # of cycles in the interval of interest was included in the calculation.  Later, when the NAF(X) was automated, only 'true' fp's (i.e., those that satisfied the foveation-window (FWIN) criteria) were used in the calculation.  For waveforms that exhibited well-developed foveation, this changed nothing.  However, for poor foveation due to excessive jitter or high velocities, many cycles were deemed to have no fp's and the resulting NAF(X) reflected only those few fp's detected.  This yielded very poor NAF(X) values that were not likely to be well correlated with acuity.  To overcome this shortcomming, a measure of the total number of potential fp's (or cycles) needs to be reintroduced.  This may be most easily accomplished by applying the NAF(X) as described below. Method and Criteria (NEW):To CALCULATE NAF(X)0, first place the 2 cursors in zoomtool to span the vertical range you wish to shift (the highest and lowest foveation points) and use 'calcshift" to calculate the offset of the analysis interval (to center the nystagmus on 0 deg); 'posubary=posubary-calcshiftval;'. Estimate the pos limit of FWIN (posLim) by dividing the 'Delta Y' value by 2. Then, use	'nff(posubary,velsubary,splfreq,[posLim,velLim],'showpv',0/1);'         [] uses default >>Displays the number of TRUE foveation periods<<                  Then, if [] detects >=1fp/cy, use the number of CYCLES in	'nff(posubary,velubary,splfreq,#fovs,'naf(p)(v)',[tauIn,posLim,velLim]);'         where "#fovs" = #cy's  (#fps - #extra fps detected)                 [0,0,0] uses default >>Displays all NAF data<<                  Else, if [] misses any cycles (i.e., no fp detected) choose the pos limit of FWIN just large enough to encompass all fp's in the interval to be used (1 fp per cycle)         Then choose the LOWEST vel limit of FWIN (velLim) that allows showpv function to detect 1fp/cy or, increase the velocity limit to the LOWEST value that MAXIMIZES the # of fp's detected and use	'nff(posubary,velubary,splfreq,#fovs,'nafx(p)(v)',[tauIn,posLim,velLim]);'         where "#fovs" = #cy's + #cy w/o fp or joined cycles within a fp         		(#cy's = #fps - #extra fps detected) >>Displays all NAFX data<<         		    NOTE: If >1 cy are included in 1 identified fp, add the # of such cycles to    		get the value of "#fovs"                              If the above method does not yield appropriate NAF(X)'s, a 'quality factor' (e.g., #cycles/#true fp's, where #cycles can be approximated using a large FWIN in 'showpv') may be needed to modify the NAX calculated with more stringent FWIN borders.  Where and how that factor would be introduced into the NAF(X) calculation would need to be determined; it could simply be a multiplier of the calculated NAF(X)...Probably NOT.Method and Criteria (OLD vs NEW):The NAFX used for the first 5 NIH patients (pre, post 1 & 6 wks) had an error in calculating the # of fps (needed to use 'ciel'). The new NAFX is correct but we retained the old (nffnih.m) for use with these patients only. Also, we decided that the correct #fps = the #cycles (NEW), not #fpsdetected + #missed (OLD). Again, we will adhere to the OLD method for the first 5 NIH patients only.To make 'NAFX.p':Go to Analysis:NAFX P fnsDelete old 'nafx.p'Edit 'nafx.m'	CMD-A, delete	Using BBEdit and CMD-A, CMD-C, and CMD-V,	Copy contents of the latest nafx.m into above file	Copy contents of the latest detectfovs.m into above file	Copy contents of the latest nafx_gui.m into above file	SAVE and exit 'nafx.m'Use 'CD2' to go to above folderCreate p-file with 'pcode nafx'
