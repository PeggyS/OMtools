(All Ihad with me was the final plot of NAFX Score vs. gaze angle)  Idon&#39;t remember if we made a real &quot;patient&quot; file for me ornot, but I would appreciate if you could forward any records we didkeep.  Also, I believe he might be emailing you about what degreeof prism you would suggest to best take advantage of my convergencenull.  I thought I remembered 6 degrees but wasn&#39;t sure.<br><br>On to the bug.<br><br>Ok, so this one was my bad.  I had a similar bug elsewhere and Iforgot when i fixed it to apply it to similar circomstances.<br><br>I&#39;ve attached an updated copy of setmdlp.m that should have fixed bothissues.<br><br>If your curious I can go into detail, otherwise feel free to skipbelow<br><br>//start detail-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ---- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --<br><br>The first bug was caused by an incorrect sizing of tool panels due tomiscounting the number of slider tools that had labels<br><br>The second bug was caused by an error created by the first.<br><br>in draw_tools the first thing that gets done is determining how bigeach tool panel has to be to fit all of the tools<br>the caveat here is that if a tool is a slider with labels, the toolpanel has to get bigger to make room for the labels.<br>so at line 831, I have it determine how many of the tools in the panelits drawing have a slider with labels, i.e.<br><br>836num_sl_labels=numel(slid_index)-numel(strfind([data{slid_index,3}],&#39;%<span></span>%%%&#39;))<br><br>where i first find the total number of sliders and subtract the numberthat don&#39;t have a label (the %% fields are blank)<br><br>but I forgot to account for the false positive of when the slider alsohas no preset limits, and there&#39;s another blank %%, making a set of%%%%%%, which the function strfind, when looking for 4 %&#39;s next to oneanother will count all 3 groupings of 4 adjacent %&#39;s in a group of 6. So to fix this I simply added in whenever it finds a group of5.<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>Thus the corrected line is<br><br>836 num_sl_labels=numel(slid_index)-umel(strfind([data{slid_index,3<span></span>}],&#39;%%%%&#39;))+numel(strfind([data{slid_index,3}],&#39;%%%%%&#39;));<br><br>-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ---- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --- -- - --//<br><br>Please let me know whenever you encounter any further issues. Some light coding is a nice refresher from the hours and hoursof case histories.<br><br><br><br>Joel Simon<br><br><br>Case Western Reserve University<br>School Of Law<br>cell:      (201) 874-0883<br></blockquote><blockquote>email:  &lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:joel.simon@case.edu" target="_blank">joel.simon@case.edu</a>&gt;<a href="mailto:joel.simon@case.edu" target="_blank">joel.simon@case.edu</a><br>      :  &lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:truebluefunk@gmail.com" target="_blank">truebluefunk@gmail.com</a>&gt;<a href="mailto:truebluefunk@gmail.com" target="_blank">truebluefunk@gmail.com</a><br></blockquote><blockquote><br><br><br>On Fri, Sep 25, 2009 at 10:15 AM, L.
