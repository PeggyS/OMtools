Robinson PMC block notes:This is the block in Robinson's model responsible for ringing/oscillation.  The frequency of this response is wholly dependent on tau3, the delay in the feedback loop.  In the model as originally presented, tau3 is 30 ms, 5 ms less than the forward time delay (tau2) of 35 ms.tau3 (ms):   freq (Hz):     -------------------------------------------------------------   5				~3.67      |       105				1.616          10				~3.6       |       110				1.5625             15				3.4        |       115				1.5286            20				3.22       |       120				1.4758             25				3.1        |       125				1.4484            30				2.972      |       130				1.3935  35				2.85       |       135				1.3657            40				2.732      |       140				1.3362              45				2.624      |       145				1.2997              50				2.5        |       150				1.2684              55				2.38       |       155				1.2389             60				2.2636     |       160				1.2142                65				2.179      |       165				1.1871                70				2.092      |       170				1.1612               75				1.994      |       175				1.1364              80				1.92       |       180				1.096              85				1.85       |       185				1.0898                90				1.799      |       190				1.0727             95				1.735      |       195				1.0555              100				1.6795     |       200				1.0           When tau3 is 30 ms, the model rings, but will not oscillate.  Only when tau3 is increased to at least 50 ms will oscillation occur.To cause oscillation at higher frequencies, it is necessary to add a gain greater than unity to the feedback loop.  However, if this is the only modification made, the output of the block will be incorrect, with the velocity reduced by the a factor equal to the feedback gain.  For example, if the input (target) velocity is 5 deg/sec, and the feedback gain is 2.0, the output velocity will be only 2.5 deg/sec, which is clearly incorrect, as CN does NOT cause a diminishment in smooth pursuit ability.Therefore we need to add a second gain, this time to the feedforward leg.  This gain is placed between the feedback point and the output, and is equal to the feedback gain.  This corrects the output velocity, allowing it to match the input velocity.As before, the frequency of oscillation is wholly dependent on tau3, but note that this frequency is NOT the same as above.tau3 (ms):   freq (Hz):     --------------------------   5				4.54        10				4.17                  15				3.8506          20				3.57         25				3.33            30				3.125    By increasing the value of the feedback and feedforward gains, we increase the magnitude of the velocity oscillation.  This does NOT change the frequency of the oscillation.  Additionally, as these gains increase, the time taken to reach the maximal oscillation increases.  For example, with a gain slightly above that required to induce oscillation, the steady-state peak-to-peak magnitude is reached within one cycle, whereas for a gain of 4.0, it takes several cycles (up to 1.5 seconds) to build up to the steady-state P-P value.I have yet to find a way to circumvent or shorten this time needed to reach final value (assuming that it _is_ a problem, and not a feature).  Neither changes to the integrator gain, nor to the pole position have helped.It may not actually be a problem, after all, since there has been no thorough examination of CN "start up," as someone switches from a quiescent state to an active waveform.  Therefore we can't necessarily say that the CN doesn't take several cycles to reach its cruising altitude.The initial tests of this model were performed using a 5 deg/sec stimulus.  Fortunately the model can be driven to almost the same exact behavior with much smaller inputs.  For example, a small, band-limited white noise source also causes oscillation at the same frequency (of course) and _amplitude_ as the larger signal.  The only difference is the  amplitudes of the first few cycles.
