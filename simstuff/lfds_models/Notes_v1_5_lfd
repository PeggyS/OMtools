Notes: v1.425_lfd4/28/09: Added several missing parts and set amplifier gains in Fast and Slow OMNs to 1 (they were 0.5 and did not exist in v1.4). Did the same for the gains in Fast and Slow OMNs in Model Plant+ (they also did not exist in v1.4). Model v1.425 now works.Notes: v1.5_lfd4/30/09: Added a formula for the gain P1 in Target Velocity Reconstruction circuit that is based on the value put into Model Params for "Tenotomy Effect" (see TrgtReconGain_Tenot.xls file)5/15/09: Changed Slow NI to Slow rNI9/22/09: Changed connections in IM and Saccadic Motor Control [Updated Diag OMSim]9/22/09: Added 25 msec delay in Saccadic Motor Control (also in v1.5_lfd043009)12/8/09: Removed the 25 msec delay from Saccadic Motor Control (was mistakenly added on 9/22/09) (also in v1.5_lfd043009) [With that delay, the saccadic latency was drastically lengthened to ~400 msec!]
